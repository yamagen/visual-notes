## About

This is a collection of visual notes: sketches, diagrams, and images that reflect thoughts I chose not to put into words.

Each image is a record, not just of what was seen, but of how it felt.

These notes are not necessarily complete or formal.  
They are moments of perception, hesitation, rhythm, and mood drawning instead of said.

## Structure

- `images/` contains original drawings or photographs.
- Optional `notes/` or `captions/` folders may hold Markdown reflections or filenames as metadata.

## Purpose

To document things that could not be expressed fully in language,  
and to keep track of what drawing, framing, and seeing left behind.
